# PWA retrofit

Progressive Web Apps are *progressive enhancements*. Supported browers can offer installation and offline functionality but unsupported browsers still get an online experience.

The technology is typically used for web apps but can be applied to any website as demonstrated here.


## Usage
Ensure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed then start the web server with:

    node ./server.js [port]

`[port]` is optional and defaults to 8888.

Load the demonstration home page at [http://localhost:8888/](http://localhost:8888/) (or which ever port you specified). Recommendations:

1. Open the site in Chrome's incognito window.
1. Open the Developer Tools and View the **Application** tab.
